# Hi, I’m Jack :smile:

I’m a second-year electrical engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for problem-solving, innovation, and collaboration.

I'm working on embedded systems, developing drones for a design team at Waterloo - Waterloo Ariel Robotics Group (WARG). Through this experience 
I developed my C, C++, and source control skills. In the future, I would like to increase my fluency in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS.
